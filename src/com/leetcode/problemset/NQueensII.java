 * 
 * 52. N-Queens II
 * 
 * The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
 *
 * Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown below.
	[
	 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
	  "...Q",
	  "Q...",
	  "..Q."],
	
	 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
	  "Q...",
	  "...Q",
	  ".Q.."]
	]
