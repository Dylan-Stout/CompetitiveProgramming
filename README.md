# Competitive Programming 

This repository will be used as a store of all my practice work for competitive programming Algorithms, Data Structures, 
Machine Learning, Artifical Intelligence, and more. Hopefully others can learn from my failures (maybe some triumphs...maybe). 

The problems will come from places like LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksForGeeks, and others. Unit tests for those who want 
to do the problems on your own and make me look like an ape banging on keys. 


The following are problems that have been attempted in this competitive programming project:
