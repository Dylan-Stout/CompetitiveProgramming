This repository will be used as a store all my  practice work for competitive programming Algorithms, Data Structures, 
Machine Learning, Artifical Intelligence, and more. Hopefully others can learn from my failures (maybe some triumphs...maybe). 

Most problems will come from places like LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksForGeeks, and others. Unit tests for those who wants 
to try the problems on your own and make me look like an ape banging on keys.
