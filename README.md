# Competitive Programming Java

This repository will be used as a store of all my practice work for competitive programming: Algorithms, Data Structures, 
Machine Learning, Artifical Intelligence, and more. 

Hopefully others can learn from my failures (maybe some triumphs...maybe)

The problems will come from places like LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksForGeeks, and others. This also means I will mark solutions as solved if it passes the tests on the given site (I.E. a LeetCode submission is 100% correct). Unit tests are provided for those who want to attempt these problems on your own.

The following are problems that have been attempted/solved:
